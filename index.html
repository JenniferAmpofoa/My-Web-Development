<h2>Discover My Passion for Web Development</h2>
 My journey as a web developer began when I stumbled upon A Lecturer who introduced FreeCodeCamp to our class. At that time, I was looking for ways to improve my coding skills, and FreeCodeCamp seemed like the perfect platform. The interactive coding challenges, real-world projects, and supportive community drew me in, and I quickly became hooked.
   
   As I progressed through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, I gained a solid foundation in HTML. I built several projects, including a personal portfolio website. These projects helped me develop problem-solving skills, learn how to debug code, and understand the importance of version control using Git.
  
   <p>Struggle is Real</p>
   
   However, my journey was not without its challenges. There were times when I felt frustrated, stuck, or unsure about how to proceed. I remember spending hours trying to understand a complex concept. But I persisted, and with the help of the FreeCodeCamp community, I was able to overcome these obstacles.
   
   One of the biggest challenges I faced was deploying my projects to a live server. I had heard of GitHub Pages, but I didn't know how to use it. After some research and trial-and-error, I finally managed to deploy my survey website using GitHub Pages. It was a thrilling moment, seeing my project live on the internet!

   <p>Hosting and Deployment</p>
   
   As I continued to build more projects, I realized the importance of hosting and deployment. I started using Netlify, a popular platform for hosting and deploying web applications. Netlify offered a free plan, which was perfect for my needs. I could deploy my projects with ease, and Netlify would take care of the rest.
   
   However, I soon discovered that Netlify had some limitations. For example, it didn't support server-side rendering (SSR) out of the box. I had to use workarounds, such as using a third-party library or creating a custom solution. But overall, Netlify was a great choice for hosting and deploying my web applications.

   <p>Troubleshooting and Debugging<p>
   
   As any web developer knows, troubleshooting and debugging are essential skills. I learned how to use the browser's developer tools to inspect elements, debug JavaScript code, and analyze network requests. I also learned how to use debugging tools like console.log() and the Chrome DevTools.
   
   One of the most frustrating experiences I had was trying to debug a complex issue with my React application. The issue was causing the application to crash, but I couldn't figure out what was causing it. After hours of debugging, I finally discovered that the issue was caused by a subtle bug in one of my React components. It was a tough lesson, but it taught me the importance of perseverance and attention to detail.

   <p>FreeCodeCamp and the Community<p>
   
   Throughout my journey, FreeCodeCamp has been an invaluable resource. The platform provided me with a structured learning path, interactive coding challenges, and real-world projects. But what I appreciate most about FreeCodeCamp is the community.
   
   The FreeCodeCamp community is supportive, encouraging, and knowledgeable. I've received help from experienced developers, gotten feedback on my projects, and learned from others' experiences. The community has been instrumental in my growth as a web developer, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to be a part of it.

   <br>Conclusion</br>

   
   My journey as a web developer has been a wild ride, full of ups and downs. But through it all, I've learned valuable skills, gained experience as a developers. If you're just starting out on your own web development journey, I hope my story can serve as encouragement and inspiration. Keep pushing forward, and don't be afraid!
